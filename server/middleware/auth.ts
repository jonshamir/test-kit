 * How logging in works, from the server's side.
 *
 * When someone logs in, Supabase gives the browser a "token" - a long string
 * that says who they are, signed by Supabase so it cannot be faked. The
 * browser sends it with every request (client/lib/api.ts does this for you):
 *
 *     Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGci...
 *
 * Our job here is to check that signature. We do it ourselves, using
 * Supabase's public keys, so there is no extra round trip to Supabase on
 * every single request.

 * You will read elsewhere that server code must not keep anything in a
 * variable between requests, and that is right - Cloudflare can throw your
 * server away at any moment. This is the rare exception, and only because
 * nothing breaks if it disappears: these are public keys, and losing them
 * just means fetching them again. Never cache user data like this.
