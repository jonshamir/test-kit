 * The Supabase client for the SERVER.

 *
 * Because it can read and write anything, YOUR handler is what keeps users
 * apart. Whenever data belongs to a person, filter by their id:
 *
 *     .eq("owner_id", c.var.user.id)
 *
 * Build a new one per request. Do not make one at the top of a file: it needs
 * values from `c.env`, which only exist once a request arrives.
