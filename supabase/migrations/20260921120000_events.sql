-- Row Level Security: ON, with NO policies. This is deliberate.
--
-- "No policies" means "nobody gets through". That makes the publishable key in
-- the browser useless for reading this table, which is exactly what we want:
-- all data access goes through our server, which uses the secret key and
-- bypasses RLS.
--
-- Do not add policies here. Decide who can see what in server/routes/, where
-- you can read the code and test it. See AGENTS.md.
