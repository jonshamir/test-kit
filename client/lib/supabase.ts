/**
 * The Supabase client for the BROWSER.
 *
 * It is used for ONE thing: logging in and out, and knowing who is logged in.
 *
 * It is NOT used to read or write your data. Every table has Row Level
 * Security turned on with no policies, which makes the publishable key
 * useless for data access - on purpose. To read data, call the server:
 *
 *     import { api } from "./api";
 *     const events = await api("/api/events");
 *
 * See AGENTS.md for why.
 */
/*
 * The two fallbacks below matter more than they look.
 *
 * createClient throws immediately if the URL is empty, and this file is
 * imported on every page - so before anything renders. On a fresh clone
 * with an empty .env that means a blank white page and a console error,
 * instead of the "you have not set up Supabase yet" screen.
 *
 * So we hand it harmless placeholders when nothing is configured. Nothing
 * calls out to them: SUPABASE_ENABLED is false, and the app shows the
 * setup message instead.
