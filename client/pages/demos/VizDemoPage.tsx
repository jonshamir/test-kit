      <ul>
        <li>We are getting data from a publicly accessible API.</li>
        <li>
          When the data is loaded, we transform it into a shape our chart
          expects.
        </li>
        <li>
          We pass the transformed data into the chart so it can render to the
          UI.
        </li>
        <li>
          We created a reusable custom chart component
          (client/features/budget/BudgetChart.tsx) instead of inlining all our
          chart code here.
        </li>
        <li>
          The charting library we are using has lots of chart types, see{" "}
